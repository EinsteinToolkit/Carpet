    <h1>Carpet Version 4</h1>

    <p>Version 4 will be the next release of Carpet, which is still
    under development.  This page describes the current state of the
    development version and lists the changes from Version 3.</p>

    <p>Main contributors to this version were, so far,
    <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/">Erik Schnetter</a>
    (LSU),
    <a href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/~tradke/">Thomas Radke</a> (AEI), and
    <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~cott/">Christian D. Ott</a>
    (UA).  Special thanks go to Luca Baiotti, Denis Pollney, Christian
    Reisswig, Jian Tao, and also to
    the <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/numerical/">CCT numerical
    relativity group</a>, the <a href="http://numrel.aei.mpg.de/">AEI
    numerical relativity group</a>, and
    the <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/xirel/">XiRel
    collaboration</a>.</p>



    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The data structures and algorithms storing and handling
      the communication schedule are much more efficient on large
      numbers (several hundred or more) processors.  This makes Carpet
      scale to more than 8,000 cores.</p></li>

      <li><p>The interface for defining and making dynamic changes to
      grid hierarchies is simpler, and buffer zones are handled in a
      cleaner manner.  This makes it easier to write user code which
      defines or updates the grid hierarchy, and reduces the chance of
      inconsistencies therein.</p></li>

      <li><p>During checkpointing and recovery, the grid structure is
      saved and restored by default.  This avoids accidental changes
      upon recovery.</p></li>

      <li><p>The efficiency of I/O has been increased, especially for
      HDF5 based binary I/O.  It is possible to combine several
      variables into one file to reduce the number of output
      files.</p></li>

      <li><p>A new thorn LoopControl offers iterators over grid
      points, implemented as C-style macros.  These iterators allow
      additional important loop-level optimisations, such
      as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_tiling">loop
      tiling</a> or
      <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> parallelisation.
      Efficient cache handling and hybrid communication models have a
      large potential for performance improvements on current and
      future architectures.</p></li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Changes in Detail</h2>

    <h3>Initial Data</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The parameter <code>Carpet::enable_all_storabe</code> is
      off by default, reducing memory usage.  This can uncover hidden
      errors in schedule.ccl files.  You can use poisoning
      (<code>Carpet::poison_new_timelevels = yes</code>) to find these
      problems.</p></li>

      <li><p>The parameter <code>Carpet::regrid_in_level_mode</code>
      is on by default.  This balances the load more efficiently
      between processors, especially for multi-patch
      simulations.</p></li>

      <li><p>Carpet requires thorn InitBase.  This allows Carpet to
      check whether its handling of initial data is consistent with
      other thorns, assuming that the other thorns also use InitBase.
      A new parameter <code>Carpet::init_fill_timelevels</code>
      instructs Carpet to initialise all past time levels by making
      copies of the current time level, very similar to
      what <code>MoL::initial_data_is_crap</code> does.</p></li>

      <li><p>Buffer zones are specified differently.  Buffer zones are
      enabled by setting <code>use_buffer_zones</code>, and outer
      buffer zones are now the default.  (Outer buffer zones are added
      to the outside of the refined levels, instead of taking away
      grid points from the interior of the refined levels.)  The
      necessary number of buffer zones is calculated automatically if
      thorn MoL is used for time evolution.</p></li>

      <li><p>There are new schedule
      bins <code>CCTK_PREREGRIDINITIAL</code>
      and <code>CCTK_POSTREGRIDINITIAL</code>, called before and after
      regridding during initial data setup, respectively.  As a rule
      of thumb, routines scheduled in <code>CCTK_BASEGRID</code> must
      also be scheduled in both <code>CCTK_POSTREGRID</code>
      and <code>CCTK_POSTREGRIDINITIAL</code>.  You can use poisoning
      (see above) to catch errors in your schedule.ccl files.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Grid Structure</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Thorn CarpetRegrid2 stores its state in grid variables
      instead of in parameters.  This makes it easier to modify the
      grid hierarchy from other thorns, and is automatically
      consistent upon checkpointing and recovery.  It also simplifies
      outputting the grid structure to files.  These state variables
      can be modified at any time, but their values are only
      significant during regridding.</p></li>

      <li><p>There is a new
      parameter <code>CarpetRegrid2::symmetry_rotating180</code>,
      which forces the generated grid structure to have the correct
      symmetry for a 180 degree rotational symmetry about
      the <code>z</code> axis.  (It is unfortunate that errors in the
      symmetry of the grid structure do not lead to errors but are
      currently silently ignored.  You can use poisoning -- see above
      -- to catch errors in the grid structure.)  A
      parameter <code>CarpetRegrid2::symmetry_rotating90</code> is
      planned, but not yet implemented.</p></li>

      <li><p>Checkpointing saves and restores the grid structure by
      default.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I/O</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>All Carpet I/O thorns support the new
      parameter <code>one_file_per_group</code>, which combines all
      variables from a variable group into a single file.  This
      reduces the number of output files.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communication, Mesh Refinement</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The algorithm determining the communication schedule is
      new and much more fussy.  It will detect all (one hopes)
      inconsistencies in the grid structure.  (Note that this does
      unfortunately not include errors regarding the outer or symmetry
      boundaries.)</p></li>

      <li><p>The communication schedule is stored in a compressed
      (sparse) form.  This is necessary since the communication
      schedule between N processors has N<sup>2</sup> entries, which
      cannot be handled efficiently in full.</p></li>

      <li><p>The prolongation operators have been rewritten.  Time
      interpolation is now handled separately, reducing the number of
      operators.</p></li>

      <li><p>Some unused CarpetLib parameters have been removed, some
      new CarpetLib parameters have been introduced.  The default
      settings should be reasonable.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>New Thorns</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Carpet uses the new
      thorn <code>CactusBase/InitBase</code>.  Update from the Cactus
      CVS repository to obtain this thorn.</p></li>

      <li><p>A new thorn <code>Carpet/CarpetMask</code> can be used to
      exclude certain regions, such as e.g. the interior of black
      holes, from global reduction operations.  This allows meaningful
      norms of constraints
      when <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3101">Turduckened</a>
      initial data are used.</p></li>

      <li><p>Carpet offers a new thorn <code>Carpet/LoopControl</code>
      providing iterators over grid points.  These iterators are
      implemented as C-style macros which can replace <code>for</code>
      or <code>do</code> loops over grid functions.  LoopControl
      provides loop tiling for increased cache efficiency, and OpenMP
      parallelisation to reduce parallelisation overhead on multi-core
      machines.</p></li>
    </ul>
