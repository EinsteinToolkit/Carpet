      the <a href="http://www.alcf.anl.gov/resources/storage.php">Surveyor</a>

      reducing the optimisation level).  For these benchmarks, the
      problem size was reduced to about one eighth of the standard
      size, using 13<sup>3</sup> grid points per core.  The results
      show that Carpet scales fine up to the size of the total machine
      (4k cores), but further work on compiler options is

    <p><b>March 20, 2009:</b> Carpet can now perform <i>performance
      experiments</i> by artificially increasing the size or the
      number of MPI messages exchanged between processes.  This can
      help determine whether either the communication bandwidth or the
      communication latency are a bottleneck of a particular
      simulation.  The figure to the right shows results for the
      standard <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/McLachlan/">McLachlan</a>

    <p><b>November 9, 2008:</b> In the context of
      the <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/xirel/">XiRel project</a>,
      we re-designed Carpet's communication layer to avoid many
      operations that had a cost of O(<var>N</var>), growing linearly
      with the number of MPI processes.  Such costs are generally not
      acceptable when running on several thousand cores, and have to
      be reduced e.g. to O(log <var>N</var>).  Carpet now stores the
      communication schedule (mostly) in a distributed manner,
      increasing performance and reducing its memory requirement.

      Factory</i></a>, a tool to help access remote HPC systems,
      manage source trees, and submit and control simulations.  The
      Simulation Factory contains a set of abstractions of the tasks
      which are necessary to set up and successfully finish numerical
      simulations using the Cactus framework.  These abstractions hide
      tedious low-level management tasks, they capture "best
      practices" of experienced users, and they create a log trail
      ensuring repeatable and well-documented scientific results.
      Using these abstractions, many types of potentially disastrous
      user errors are avoided, and different supercomputers can be
      used in a uniform manner.</p>

    <p><b>March 1, 2008:</b> We have improved the development version
    of Carpet significantly:<br /></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The data structures and algorithms storing and handling
      the communication schedule are much more efficient on large
      numbers (several hundred or more) processors.  This makes Carpet
      scale to more than 8,000 cores.</p></li>

      <li><p>The interface for defining and making dynamic changes to
      grid hierarchies is simpler, and buffer zones are handled in a
      cleaner manner.  This makes it easier to write user code which
      defines or updates the grid hierarchy, and reduces the chance of
      inconsistencies therein.</p></li>

      <li><p>During checkpointing and recovery, the grid structure is
      saved and restored by default.  This avoids accidental changes
      upon recovery.</p></li>

      <li><p>The efficiency of I/O has been increased, especially for
      HDF5 based binary I/O.  It is possible to combine several
      variables into one file to reduce the number of output
      files.</p></li>

      <li><p>A new thorn LoopControl offers iterators over grid
      points, implemented as C-style macros.  These iterators allow
      additional important loop-level optimisations, such
      as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_tiling">loop
      tiling</a> or
      <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> parallelisation.
      Efficient cache handling and hybrid communication models have a
      large potential for performance improvements on current and
      future architectures.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>More details can be found <a href="version-4.html">here</a>.
    These improvements are largely due
    to <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/">Erik Schnetter</a>

    <p><b>March 1, 2008:</b> The development version of Carpet is now
    maintained using <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> instead

    similar set of features to darcs, most importantly supporting
    decentralised development.  Git has a much larger user community
    than darcs, and we hope that this makes it easier to use.
    The <a href="get-carpet.html">download instructions</a> contain

        and
        <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a>, using the shared
        memory capabilities of Ranger's nodes to reduce the memory
        overhead of parallelisation.  We are grateful for the help we
        received from Ranger's support team.</p>
      <p>The graph below shows weak scaling tests for both unigrid and
        mesh refinement benchmarks.  The problem size per core was
        kept fixed, and there were 4 OpenMP threads per MPI process,
        with 1 MPI process per socket.  The benchmark was also run
        with the PUGH driver for comparison for certain core counts.
        As the graphs show, this benchmark scales near perfectly for
        unigrid, and has only small variations in run time for nine
        levels of mesh refinement.</p>

    <p><b>October 3, 2007:</b> Carpet's timing infrastructure has been
      extended to automatically measure both time spent computing and
      time spent in I/O.  The performance of large simulations depends
      not only on the computational efficiency and communication
      latency, but also on the throughput to file servers.  These new
      statistics give a real-time overview and can point out
      performance problems.  The statistics are collected in the
      existing <tt>Carpet::timing</tt> variables.</p>

    apparent horizon centroids, merging and un-merging refined regions
    as necessary.  (<a href="movies/bh2.gif">Movie</a>, animated gif,
    730&nbsp;kB.)  After Burkhard Zink's mechanism
    which <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0501080">tracks the
    density maximum in a star</a>, this is the second implementation
    of a production level adaptive mesh refinement criterion in
    Carpet.</p>

    <p><b>February 25, 2006:</b> The
    official <a href="http://www.cactuscode.org/Benchmarks/">Cactus
    benchmarks</a> now include benchmarks with Carpet.  You can assess
    Carpet's scaling and compare its performance on different machines
    by generating graphs from the benchmark result database on these
    pages.</p>

    <p><b>July 15, 2005:</b> We have now a page that links to <a
    href="status-reports.html">all past montly status reports</a>.</p>

    <p><b>June 6, 2005:</b> We have updated the <a
    href="get-carpet-darcs.html">downloading instructions for
    Carpet</a>.</p>

    <p><b>June 6, 2005:</b> Version 1.0.3 of the pre-compiled darcs
    binary is <a href="get-carpet-darcs.html">now available</a>.</p>

    <p><b>April 13, 2005:</b> Thomas Radke has implemented a new
    communication scheme in Carpet.  Instead of sending many small
    messages in an interleaved manner, Carpet now collects all
    messages into an internal buffer and sends only one big message
    with MPI.  This circumvents certain problems with internal
    limitations of MPICH, and it also improves the performance
    greatly.</p>

    <p><b>March 9, 2005:</b> We have started to move towards a new
    stable version of Carpet.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><b>December 7, 2004:</b> Jonathan Thornburg is organising a <a
    href="design-walkthrough.html">Carpet Design Walkthrough</a>,
    which will take place December 13 to 15 at the AEI and will be
    broadcast via the accessgrid and/or telephone.</p>

    <p><b>Sepbember 18, 2004:</b> There is now a new repository for
    the development version of Carpet.  This repository is managed by
    <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a> instead of <a
    href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>.  Darcs has a number of
    advantages, such as being able to use it while offline, or keeping
    some changes to yourself while developing.  This development
    version is <a href="get-carpet-darcs.html">publicly available</a>,
    and we encourage you to <a
    href="work-with-darcs.html">contribute</a>.  Note that the stable
    version of Carpet is still distributed via CVS.</p>

    <p><b>August 24, 2004:</b> The version of Carpet in the CVS
    repository is now stable.  That means that this version will see
    no substantial further development.  One of its main goal is to
    not change, so that parameter files continue to work unchanged
    with identical results.  We will continue to correct errors that
    we find in this version of Carpet; however, if this would
    necessitate major changes, and there is a work-around, then this
    might not happen in the interest of stability.</p>

    <p><b>July 31, 2004:</b> Carpet seems to have reached a point
    where it is stable enough to be useful for at least some projects.
    Consequently, people expressed the wish to have a version of
    Carpet which is stable and sees no disrupting development.  The
    idea is to have two "branches" of Carpet: a stable version for
    production use, and a development version which might not be as
    stable.  We plan to make the split in about three weeks.  The
    discussion about this is held on the mailing list; your input is
    welcome.</p>

    <p><b>April 7, 2004:</b> Up to now, all Carpet thorns have been
    living in a single arrangement for Cactus.  This caused problems,
    because stable thorns, development thorns, and outdated thorns
    were sitting next to each other, confusing newcomers.  We have <a
    href="get-carpet-darcs.html">moved the Carpet arrangement</a> to a
    new repository and split it into four.  Access to the old Carpet
    arrangement has been disabled.</p>

    <p><b>March 3, 2004:</b> We have recently had trouble with I/O
    throuth the <a
    href="http://vis.lbl.gov/~jshalf/FlexIO/">FlexIO</a>
    library.  We suspect that it might have a bug that causes HDF5
    output to fail under certain, random conditions.  We have written
    a new thorn CarpetIOHDF5 which uses the <a
    href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library directly,
    while remaining compatible to the FlexIO file format.  Please test
    this thorn, and report any problems or incompatibilities you
    find.</p>

    <p>In <b>January 2004</b>, <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kobras/">Daniel
    Kobras</a> set up <a href="http://bugs.carpetcode.org/">Bugzilla
    for Carpet</a>.  <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
    is a bug-tracking system that will, so we hope, help us remember
    what is missing or broken in Carpet.</p>

    <p>In <b>October 2003</b>, Erik Schnetter, Scott H. Hawley, and
    Ian Hawke published the preprint "Evolutions in 3D numerical
    relativity using fixed mesh refinement" as <a
    href="http://arXiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0310042">gr-qc/0310042</a>.  Its
    main point is to present tests of Carpet with the BSSN code (AEI's
    spacetime evolution code), and to show that mesh refinement does
    not introduce instabilities.</p>

    <p>In <b>August 2003</b>, <a
    href="http://www.carpetcode.org/">these web pages</a> were
    created.</p>

    <p><b>May 2003</b> has informally been termed <a
    href="CarpetMonth/index.html">"Carpet month"</a>.  In a flurry of
    activity, bugs were fixed and some features added.  The BSSN code
    of the numerical relativity group at the <a
    href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/">AEI</a> now works together with
    Carpet.</p>
