    <p><a href="index.html"><b>New News...</b></a></p>

    <p><b>December 7, 2004:</b> Jonathan Thornburg is organising a <a
    href="design-walkthrough.html">Carpet Design Walkthrough</a>,
    which will take place December 13 to 15 at the AEI and will be
    broadcast via the accessgrid and/or telephone.</p>

    <p><b>Sepbember 18, 2004:</b> There is now a new repository for
    the development version of Carpet.  This repository is managed by
    <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a> instead of <a
    href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>.  Darcs has a number of
    advantages, such as being able to use it while offline, or keeping
    some changes to yourself while developing.  This development
    version is <a href="get-carpet-darcs.html">publicly available</a>,
    and we encourage you to <a
    href="work-with-darcs.html">contribute</a>.  Note that the stable
    version of Carpet is still distributed via CVS.</p>

    <p><b>August 24, 2004:</b> The version of Carpet in the CVS
    repository is now stable.  That means that this version will see
    no substantial further development.  One of its main goal is to
    not change, so that parameter files continue to work unchanged
    with identical results.  We will continue to correct errors that
    we find in this version of Carpet; however, if this would
    necessitate major changes, and there is a work-around, then this
    might not happen in the interest of stability.</p>

    <p><b>July 31, 2004:</b> Carpet seems to have reached a point
    where it is stable enough to be useful for at least some projects.
    Consequently, people expressed the wish to have a version of
    Carpet which is stable and sees no disrupting development.  The
    idea is to have two "branches" of Carpet: a stable version for
    production use, and a development version which might not be as
    stable.  We plan to make the split in about three weeks.  The
    discussion about this is held on the mailing list; your input is
    welcome.</p>

    <p><b>April 7, 2004:</b> Up to now, all Carpet thorns have been
    living in a single arrangement for Cactus.  This caused problems,
    because stable thorns, development thorns, and outdated thorns
    were sitting next to each other, confusing newcomers.  We have <a
    href="get-carpet-darcs.html">moved the Carpet arrangement</a> to a
    new repository and split it into four.  Access to the old Carpet
    arrangement has been disabled.</p>

    <p><b>March 3, 2004:</b> We have recently had trouble with I/O
    throuth the <a
    href="http://infinite-entropy.lbl.gov/FlexIO/">FlexIO</a>
    library.  We suspect that it might have a bug that causes HDF5
    output to fail under certain, random conditions.  We have written
    a new thorn CarpetIOHDF5 which uses the <a
    href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library directly,
    while remaining compatible to the FlexIO file format.  Please test
    this thorn, and report any problems or incompatibilities you
    find.</p>

    <p>In <b>January 2004</b>, <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kobras/">Daniel
    Kobras</a> set up <a href="http://bugs.carpetcode.org/">Bugzilla
    for Carpet</a>.  <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
    is a bug-tracking system that will, so we hope, help us remember
    what is missing or broken in Carpet.</p>

    <p>In <b>October 2003</b>, Erik Schnetter, Scott H. Hawley, and
    Ian Hawke published the preprint "Evolutions in 3D numerical
    relativity using fixed mesh refinement" as <a
    href="http://arXiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0310042">gr-qc/0310042</a>.  Its
    main point is to present tests of Carpet with the BSSN code (AEI's
    spacetime evolution code), and to show that mesh refinement does
    not introduce instabilities.</p>

    <p>In <b>August 2003</b>, <a
    href="http://www.carpetcode.org/">these web pages</a> were
    created.</p>

    <p><b>May 2003</b> has informally been termed <a
    href="CarpetMonth/index.html">"Carpet month"</a>.  In a flurry of
    activity, bugs were fixed and some features added.  The BSSN code
    of the numerical relativity group at the <a
    href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/">AEI</a> now works together with
    Carpet.</p>
