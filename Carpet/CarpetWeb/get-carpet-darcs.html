    <h1>Getting the Development Version of Carpet</h1>



    <h2>About Darcs</h2>

    <p>The development version of Carpet is now managed in a <a
    href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a> repository.  Darcs has a number
    of advantages for us developers, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You have a local copy of the repository, and can therefore
          work offline</li>
      <li>You can decide which changes you want to import and export,
          so that you can omit dangerous changes, or keep changes to
          yourself until you are ready to publish them</li>
      <li>You can undo most changes</li>
      <li>You can easily rename files and directories</li>
      <li>Darcs does not need its own server, which makes it both more
          convenient and more secure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and them some more, as described in the <a
    href="http://darcs.net/manual/">darcs manual</a>.</p>



    <h2>Getting Carpet</h2>

    <p>In order to get the <a
    href="http://www.carpetcode.org/~darcs/carpet/">development
    version of Carpet</a>, you first need to install <tt>darcs</tt> on
    your system.  This is described on the <a
    href="http://darcs.net/">darcs home page</a>, and some links to
    binaries are given in the darcs wiki.  If you have problems
    installing or using darcs in general, then you should ask on the
    darcs mailing list, which I (Erik Schnetter) read regularly.  We
    have also prepared a <a
    href="binaries/darcs-1.0.2-static-linux-i386.gz">gzipped,
    statically linked version for Linux/i386</a>.</p>

    <p>By the way, you can also have a look at <a
    href="http://www.carpetcode.org/~darcs/carpet">Carpet's source
    tree</a> in your web browser.</p>

    <p>After installing <tt>darcs</tt>, take the following steps to
    get Carpet:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Move your old version of <tt>Carpet</tt> to a secure place:
<pre>cd Cactus
mkdir oldcarpet
mv arrangements/Carpet* oldcarpet</pre></li>

      <li>Get the development version of Carpet.  Carpet consists of
          four arrangements that live in a single repository.  This
          structure is not what Cactus expects, and we will therefore
          put it outside the <tt>arrangements</tt> directory:
<pre>cd Cactus
darcs get http://www.carpetcode.org/~darcs/carpet</pre>
          This copies the whole Carpet repository, and it will take some
          time.</li>

      <li>Create some symbolic links in the arrangements directory:
<pre>cd Cactus/arrangements
ln -s ../carpet/Carpet* .</pre>
          (don't forget the dot at the end of the last line).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it; you can now recompile your Cactus/Carpet
    configurations.</p>



    <h2>Updating Carpet</h2>

    <p>At some time you will want to update your version of Carpet and
    incorporate some changes from the main Carpet repository.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>You do this with the command
<pre>cd Cactus/carpet
darcs pull</pre>
      which will look for new changes, and then ask you which of these
      you want to obtain.  Normally, you will want all changes.</li>
    </ol>



    <h2>Working with Darcs</h2>

    <p>We also have some instructions on how to <a
