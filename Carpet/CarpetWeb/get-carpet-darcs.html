    <h2>Available Versions</h2>

    <p>Carpet is distributed under the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU General
    Public License (GPL)</a>.  It might be released under the GNU
    Lesser General Public License (LGPL) in the future, to match the
    distribution terms of Cactus.</p>

    <p>There are currently three different versions of Carpet
    available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Version 1, the old stable version (via CVS)</li>
      <li>Version 2, the upcoming second stable version (via darcs;
          CVS mirror planned)</li>
      <li>Development version (via darcs)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Version 1 has been unchanged for quite some time.  There are no
    plans to make any further changes to this version unless a
    catastrophic error is detected.</p>

    <p>Version 2 is the upcoming next stable version.  This version is
    almost feature complete, but we continue to improve its
    performance for parallel communication and I/O.  This version will
    probably be released in a few week.  After its release, we will
    only correct errors, so that its users have a stable platform to
    rely on.  We recommend this version for the casual user and for
    production runs.</p>

    <p>The development version will always see changes, some of which
    might surprise you.  You should not use it without keeping close
    contact to the developers.</p>



    <h2>Getting Carpet</h2>

    <p>Carpet is a driver for Cactus.  It works as a part of Cactus,
    and you will need to have the developers' version of Cactus
    installed before you can use Carpet.  Please look at the <a
    href="http://www.cactuscode.org/">Cactus web pages</a> for an
    introduction to Cactus and for installation instructions.</p>

    <p>Carpet consists of several arrangements, each living in a
    directory.  The arrangement <code>Carpet</code> contains the basic
    driver part that everybody needs.  The arrangement
    <code>CarpetExtra</code> contains useful add-ons and some example
    code.  Development of new thorns happens in the
    <code>CarpetDev</code> arrangement, which means that the code in
    there is not to be trusted.  And finally, there is a graveyard
    arrangement <code>CarpetAttic</code> of things that only used to
    be useful and are now in a state of decay.</p>

    <h3>Version 1</h3>

    <p>Version 1 of Carpet is available via anonymous <a
    href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>:</p>
<pre>        cd Cactus/arrangements
        cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/cvs/carpet login
        cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/cvs/carpet checkout Carpet
        cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/cvs/carpet checkout CarpetExtra
        cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/cvs/carpet checkout CarpetDev</pre>
    <p>The password for anonymous CVS access is <code>anon</code>.
    Instructions for dealing with CVS are available everywhere on the
    web, e.g. also on the <a href="http://www.cactuscode.org/">Cactus
    pages</a>.</p>

    <h3>Version 2</h3>

    <p>Version 2 of Carpet is available via anonymous <a
    href="http://www.darcs.net/">darcs</a> (a CVS mirror is planned):</p>
<pre>        cd Cactus
        darcs get http://www.carpetcode.org/~darcs/carpet-stable-2
        cd arrangements
        ln -s ../carpet-stable-2/Carpet* .</pre>
    <p>(Don't miss the dot after the <code>Carpet*</code> in the last
    line.)  Instructions for using darcs are given <a
    href="#darcs">below</a>.  You can also have a look at <a
    href="http://www.carpetcode.org/home/darcs/carpet-stable-2">Carpet's
    source tree</a> in your web browser.</p>

    <h3>Development Version</h3>

    <p>The development version of Carpet is not available anonymously.
    <a href="mailto:schnetter@aei.mpg.de">Ask me</a> if you would like
    an account.  Once you have an account, you get the development
    version via</p>
<pre>        cd Cactus
        darcs get darcs@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/darcs/carpet
        cd arrangements
        ln -s ../carpet-stable-2/Carpet* .</pre>
    <p>(Don't miss the dot after the <code>Carpet*</code> in the last
    line.)  Instructions for using darcs are given <a
    href="#darcs">below</a>.</p>

    <p>We thank the <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/">Institut für
    Astronomie und Astrophysik</a> of the Universität Tübingen for
    hosting the CVS and darcs server.</p>



    <hr />

    <h2 id="darcs">Using Darcs</h2>

    <p>Carpet is managed in a <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a>
    repository instead of a CVS repository.  Darcs has a number of
    advantages over CVS for us developers, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You have a local copy of the repository, and can therefore
          work offline</li>
      <li>You can decide which changes you want to import and export,
          so that you can omit dangerous changes, or keep changes to
          yourself until you are ready to publish them</li>
      <li>You can undo most changes</li>
      <li>You can easily rename files and directories</li>
      <li>Darcs does not need its own server, which makes it both more
          convenient and more secure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and then some more, as described in the <a
    href="http://darcs.net/manual/">darcs manual</a>.</p>

    <p>If darcs is not already installed on your system, you need to
    do so.  This is described on the <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs
    home page</a>, and some links to binaries are given in the darcs
    wiki.  If you have problems installing or using darcs in general,
    then you should ask on the darcs mailing list, which I (Erik
    Schnetter) read regularly.  For your convenience, we have also
    prepared a gzipped, statically linked <a
    href="binaries/darcs-1.0.3-static-linux-i386.gz">executable of
    darcs 1.0.3</a> for Linux/i386 (2.5&nbsp;MB), and the <a
    href="doc/darcs-1.0.3.ps.gz">gzipped postscript documentation</a>
    (270&nbsp;kB) for it.</p>

    <h3>Updating the Repository from the Master</h3>

    <p>At some time you will want to update your version of Carpet and
    incorporate some changes from the main Carpet repository.  You do
    this with the command</p>
<pre>cd Cactus/carpet-stable-2
darcs pull</pre>
      <p>which will look for new changes, and then ask you which of these
      you want to obtain.  Normally, you will want all changes.</p>

    <h3>Working with Darcs</h3>

    <p>We also have some instructions on how to <a
    href="work-with-darcs.html">develop Carpet with darcs</a>.</p>
