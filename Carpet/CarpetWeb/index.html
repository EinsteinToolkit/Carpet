    <p>Carpet is a mesh refinement driver for <a
    href="http://www.cactuscode.org/">Cactus</a>.  Cactus is a
    framework for solving time-dependent partial differential
    equations on uniform grids, and Carpet is an extension of Cactus
    that make mesh refinement possible.  Carpet was originally written
    in 2001 by <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schnette/">Erik
    Schnetter</a> at the <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/">TAT</a>
    (Theoretische Astrophysik Tübingen) and is currently maintained at
    the <a href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/">AEI</a> (Max-Planck-Institut
    für Gravitationsphysik, Albert-Einstein-Institut).  These pages
    describe Carpet and its current development.</p>

    <h2>News</h2>

    <p><b>March 9, 2005:</b> We have started to move towards a new
    stable version of Carpet.</p>

    <p><b>December 7, 2004:</b> Jonathan Thornburg is organising a <a
    href="design-walkthrough.html">Carpet Design Walkthrough</a>,
    which will take place December 13 to 15 at the AEI and will be
    broadcast via the accessgrid and/or telephone.</p>

    <p><b>Sepbember 18, 2004:</b> There is now a new repository for
    the development version of Carpet.  This repository is managed by
    <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a> instead of <a
    href="https://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.  Darcs has a number of
    advantages, such as being able to use it while offline, or keeping
    some changes to yourself while developing.  This development
    version is <a href="get-carpet-darcs.html">publicly available</a>,
    and we encourage you to <a
    href="work-with-darcs.html">contribute</a>.  Note that the stable
    version of Carpet is still distributed via CVS.</p>

    <p><b>August 24, 2004:</b> The version of Carpet in the CVS
    repository is now stable.  That means that this version will see
    no substantial further development.  One of its main goal is to
    not change, so that parameter files continue to work unchanged
    with identical results.  We will continue to correct errors that
    we find in this version of Carpet; however, if this would
    necessitate major changes, and there is a work-around, then this
    might not happen in the interest of stability.</p>

    <p><b>July 31, 2004:</b> Carpet seems to have reached a point
    where it is stable enough to be useful for at least some projects.
    Consequently, people expressed the wish to have a version of
    Carpet which is stable and sees no disrupting development.  The
    idea is to have two "branches" of Carpet: a stable version for
    production use, and a development version which might not be as
    stable.  We plan to make the split in about three weeks.  The
    discussion about this is held on the mailing list; your input is
    welcome.</p>

    <p><b>April 7, 2004:</b> Up to now, all Carpet thorns have been
    living in a single arrangement for Cactus.  This caused problems,
    because stable thorns, development thorns, and outdated thorns
    were sitting next to each other, confusing newcomers.  We have <a
    href="#getting-the-code">moved the Carpet arrangement</a> to a new
    repository and split it into four.  Access to the old Carpet
    arrangement has been disabled.</p>

    <p><b>March 3, 2004:</b> We have recently had trouble with I/O
    throuth the <a
    href="http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~jshalf/FlexIO/">FlexIO</a>
    library.  We suspect that it might have a bug that causes HDF5
    output to fail under certain, random conditions.  We have written
    a new thorn CarpetIOHDF5 which uses the <a
    href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library directly,
    while remaining compatible to the FlexIO file format.  Please test
    this thorn, and report any problems or incompatibilities you
    find.</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>We have accumulated a few pieces of documentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <a href="doc/documentation.ps">introduction</a>
      (ps,&nbsp;300&nbsp;kB) to Carpet, as well as a guide to the
      first steps for using it.  Everybody should have read this.
      (This is the same as the Arrangement Guide from the Carpet
      sources.)</li>

      <li><a
      href="http://www.astro.psu.edu/nr/people/sperhake_ulrich.html">Ulrich
      Sperhake</a> wrote a tutorial outlining the <a
      href="doc/first-steps.ps">first steps</a> (ps,&nbsp;160&nbsp;kB)
      that one has to take to install Carpet and run an example
      application.</li>

      <li>An explanation of the <a href="doc/internals.ps">internal
      workings</a> (ps,&nbsp;130&nbsp;kB) of Carpet.  You should read
      this if you want to modify Carpet.</li>

      <li>The individual Thorn Guides of Carpet.  They are available
      with the source code.  They give details about the thorns' APIs
      and user interfaces.</li>

      <li>Thanks to <a
      href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>, we now
      have an <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">overview</a> over all
      the routines and data structures in Carpet.  Most individual
      Doxygen tags are still missing, but the extracted documentation
      is already very useful.  (The online documentation might not
      always be up to date; in case of doubt, extract the
      documentation yourself.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interacting with the developers</h2>

    <p>Most discussions about Carpet, i.e. user questions, feature
    requests, and bug reports, are held on the Carpet developers'
    mailing list <a
    href="mailto:developers@lists.carpetcode.org">developers@lists.carpetcode.org</a>.
    You can subscribe and unsubscribe from our <a
    href="http://lists.carpetcode.org/">list management web page</a>.
    You will also find the mailing list archive there.  We thank <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kobras/">Daniel
    Kobras</a> for managing the mailing list server.</p>

    <p>We have started to use <a
    href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> to keep track of
    requested features or reported bugs in Carpet.  You can submit or
    comment on issues from our <a
    href="http://bugs.carpetcode.org/">Bugzilla pages</a> once you
    have created an account there.  The old <a
    href="feature-requests.html">list of missing features</a> have not
    yet been moved over to Bugzilla.</p>

    <h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>

    <p>Carpet is distributed under the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU General
    Public License (GPL)</a>.  It might be released under the GNU
    Lesser General Public License (LGPL) in the future, to match the
    distribution terms of Cactus.</p>

    <p>Carpet is a driver for Cactus.  It works as a part of Cactus,
    and you will need to have the developers' version of Cactus
    installed before you can use Carpet.  Please look at the <a
    href="http://www.cactuscode.org/">Cactus web pages</a> for an
    introduction to Cactus and for installation instructions.</p>

    <p>Carpet is available via anonymous <a
    href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.  The CVSROOT is
    <code>:pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.carpetcode.org:/home/cvs/carpet</code>,
    and there are several arrangements, each living in a directory.
    The arrangement <code>Carpet</code> contains the basic driver part
    that everybody needs.  The arrangement <code>CarpetExtra</code>
    contains useful add-ons and some example code.  Development of new
    thorns happens in the <code>CarpetDev</code> arrangement, which
    means that the code in there is not to be trusted.  And finally,
    there is a graveyard arrangement <code>CarpetAttic</code> of
    things that only used to be useful and are now in a state of
    decay.</p>

    <p>The password for anonymous CVS access is <code>anon</code>.  We
    thank the <a
    href="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/">Institut für
    Astronomie und Astrophysik</a> of the Universität Tübingen for
    hosting the CVS server.</p>

    <h2>Making sense of results</h2>

    <p>Three-dimensional time-dependent simulation results are
    difficult enough to interpret when the grid is uniform.  With mesh
    refinement, the sheer amount of available data makes it necessary
    to use professional tools to examine the data.  This is not only
    the case for "big physics runs", where one (should) know in
    advance what to expect, but especially during development, where
    things do not always go as planned.  <a
    href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/~tradke/">Thomas Radke</a> was kind
    enough to write an <a
    href="http://www.cactuscode.org/VizTools/OpenDX.html">import
    module</a> for the visualisation tool <a
    href="http://www.research.ibm.com/dx/">OpenDX</a>.</p>
