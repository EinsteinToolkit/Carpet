This directory contains, in the CVS or darcs repository, the Doxygen
configuration file.  The generated documentation will also be placed
here, but should not go into the repository.

Create the Doxygen configuration by running the command

        doxygen doxygen/Doxyfile

from one directory up, i.e., from the Carpet arrangement directory.
This will create html documentation in a subdirectory html, and latex
documentation in a subdirectory latex.  The latex subdirectory
contains a makefile that creates pdf from the latex sources.
