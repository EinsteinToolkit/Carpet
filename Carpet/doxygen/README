This directory contains, in CVS, the Doxygen configuration file.  The
generated documentation will also be placed here, but should not go
into CVS.

Create the Doxygen configuration by running the command

        doxygen doxygen/Doxyfile

from one directory up, i.e. from the Carpet arrangement directory.
This will create html documentation in a subdirectory html, and latex
documentation in a subdirectory latex.  The latex subdirectory
contains a makefile that creates pdf from the latex sources.
