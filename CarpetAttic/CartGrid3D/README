1. Purpose of the thorn

This thorn sets up a Cartesian grid, for a given domain. It also
provides a method for registering symmetries of Grid Functions
across the grid axes, and a call for applying symmetry boundary
conditions.

2. Additional information

This thorn currently only works in 3D



NOTE.  This thorn is almost a copy of CactusBase/CartGrid3D.  It
contains modifications by Erik Schnetter <schnetter@uni-tuebingen.de>
to make it work with mesh refinement.  These modifications are meant
to be folded back into that very thorn.  This thorn here is only a
temporary replacement.
